## Overview

MyDeck is an Android application for managing and reading your saved articles and bookmarks with a Pocket-like user experience. It is forked from [ReadeckApp](https://github.com/jensomato/ReadeckApp) and is currently being refactored to provide a more streamlined and intuitive interface.

This app is a companion to [Readeck](https://readeck.org/en/), a self-hosted read-it-later service. To use this app, you'll need a Readeck account and server instance.

## Acknowledgements

### Major Changes

As required by the GNU GPL v3, here are the major modifications made to the original ReadeckApp:

* Rebranding as MyDeck
* Replace All and Unread views with My List view that shows all unarchived bookmarks
* Remove (for now) the Article, Photo and Video menu options
* Revise header to show view name
* Add About menu option / dialog

This list will be updated as the refactor progresses.
