# Reading

Tap any bookmark card to open it. MyDeck displays the bookmark in a view suited to its type.

## Article View

For articles, MyDeck shows the extracted text in a clean, distraction-free reading layout. The bookmark title appears at the top — tap the **✏️** icon beside it to edit the title inline and confirm with the **✓** checkmark.

### Top Bar

The top bar provides quick access to the most-used actions:

- **← Back** — return to the bookmark list
- **❤️ Favorite** — toggle the favorite status
- **Archive** — move the bookmark to the archive (or back to My List)
- **TT Typography** — open the reading settings sheet
- **🔍 Find in Article** — search for text within the article
- **⋮ More** — overflow menu with additional actions

As you scroll down to read, the top bar hides to give you more screen space. It reappears when you scroll back toward the top or when you reach the end of the article.

### Finding Text

Tap **🔍** to open the in-article search bar. Type to search; matching text in the article is highlighted. If there are multiple matches, the current one is highlighted in amber and others in yellow. Use the **↑** and **↓** arrows to move between matches. The counter shows your current position (e.g., "2/5").

## Typography Settings

Tap **TT** in the top bar to open the reading settings sheet.

- **Font** — scroll the font row to choose from: System Default, Noto Serif, Literata, Source Serif, Noto Sans, or JetBrains Mono
- **Font size** — tap **−** or **+** to adjust (shown as a percentage of the default)
- **Spacing** — Tight or Loose
- **Width** — Wide or Narrow
- **Justify text** — toggle on or off
- **Hyphenate words** — toggle on or off
- **Reset to defaults** — restore all reading settings at once

These settings are saved automatically and apply to every article you read.

## Video View

For video bookmarks (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.), MyDeck shows the title, a description, and an embedded video player. Videos stream from their original servers and require an internet connection.

The top bar in video view shows **← Back**, **❤️**, **Archive**, and **⋮** only — Typography and Find in Article are not available for video bookmarks.

## Picture View

For picture bookmarks, MyDeck shows the title, a description, and the stored image at full content width.

The top bar in picture view shows **← Back**, **❤️**, **Archive**, and **⋮** only.

## View Original

Any bookmark can be opened in its original format in an in-app web viewer.

- **From article view:** tap **⋮** → **View Original**
- **From View Original:** tap **⋮** → **View Article** to return to the reading view

> **No article content:** If Readeck was unable to extract article content when the bookmark was saved, MyDeck automatically opens the bookmark in View Original instead of showing an empty reading view. In that case, the overflow menu will show **View Article** (to attempt the reading view) rather than **View Original**.

## Overflow Menu

Tap **⋮** in the top bar for additional actions:

- **View Original / View Article** — switch between the reading view and the original web page in an in-app viewer (see above)
- **Open in Browser** — open the original URL in your default browser
- **Share Link** — open the Android share sheet to share the bookmark's URL
- **Unread / Read** — toggle whether the bookmark has been read; this is reflected back in the bookmark list
- **Bookmark Details** — open the Bookmark Details screen (see below)
- **Delete** — delete the bookmark; a **"Bookmark deleted"** bar appears with an **Undo** option

## Long-press Context Menu

Long-pressing a link in the article opens a context menu:
- Copy Link Address
- Copy Link Text
- Share Link
- Open in Browser

Long-pressing an image opens an extended menu that also includes Copy Image, Download Image, and Share Image.

## Bookmark Details

**Bookmark Details** (opened from the overflow menu) shows the bookmark's full metadata:

- Thumbnail
- Author, date added, date published, reading time, word count
- Description
- **Labels** — add or remove labels for this bookmark; see [Organising](./organising.md) for the full guide to working with labels
