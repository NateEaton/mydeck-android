# Labels

Labels let you organise your bookmarks into any categories you like. You can add as many labels as you want to a bookmark, and there's no limit on what a label can be — words, phrases, or even emojis.

To add labels to a bookmark, see [Bookmark View](./bookmark.md#labels).

## Label List

Open the navigation drawer and tap **Labels** to see all your labels. Each label shows a count of how many bookmarks carry it. Tap a label to filter the bookmark list to only bookmarks with that label.

## Rename or Delete a Label

From the **Labels** section in the navigation drawer, you can rename or delete existing labels. Renaming a label updates it across all bookmarks that carry it.
