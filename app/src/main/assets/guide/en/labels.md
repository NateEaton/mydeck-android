# Labels

Labels let you organise your bookmarks into any categories you like. You can add as many labels as you want to a bookmark, and there's no limit on what a label can be — words, phrases, or even emojis.

To add labels to a bookmark, see [Bookmark View](./bookmark.md#labels).

## Label List

Open the navigation drawer and tap **Labels** to open the Labels sheet. It shows all your labels with a count of how many bookmarks each one has.

Tap a label to see all bookmarks carrying that label.

## Rename or Delete a Label

There are two ways to rename or delete a label:

- **From the label list:** Long-press a label in the Labels sheet to rename or delete it.
- **From a label's bookmark list:** When viewing bookmarks for a given label, tap the **⋮** overflow menu in the top bar and choose **Rename label** or **Delete label**.

Renaming a label updates it across all bookmarks that carry it.
