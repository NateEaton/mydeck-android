# Your Bookmarks

Bookmarks are the web pages, articles, and videos you've saved to your Readeck server. MyDeck syncs them to your device so you can read them anytime, even offline.

## Navigating Your Bookmarks

Tap the **menu icon** (☰) in the top-left corner to open the navigation drawer. The drawer lets you browse a specific subset of your bookmarks:

- **My List** — bookmarks you haven't archived yet (your default reading queue)
- **Archive** — bookmarks you've moved to the archive
- **Favorites** — bookmarks you've marked as a favorite (these can be in My List or the Archive)
- **Articles** — article-type bookmarks only
- **Videos** — video-type bookmarks only
- **Pictures** — picture-type bookmarks only
- **Labels** — browse bookmarks by label; tap a label to see all bookmarks with that label

Each item shows a count of how many bookmarks it contains.

## Bookmark Cards

Each item in the list is a bookmark card. Every card shows the bookmark's **title**, **site name**, estimated **reading time**, and any **labels** assigned to it. If a bookmark has more labels than fit on one line, you can scroll the label row horizontally.

Tap anywhere on a card (except the action buttons) to open the bookmark.

### Grid Layout

The default layout. Each card has a **thumbnail** on the left and the title, source, and other details on the right. A **reading progress indicator** appears in the top-right corner of the thumbnail (see [Reading Progress](#reading-progress) below).

### Compact Layout

A denser view that uses the site's **favicon** instead of a full thumbnail. Reading progress is not shown in compact layout. Useful when you want to scan a long list quickly.

### Mosaic Layout

Each card is a large tile with the thumbnail filling the entire card and the title overlaid at the bottom. Labels are not shown in mosaic layout.

### Switching Layouts

Tap the **layout icon** in the top bar to choose between Grid, Compact, and Mosaic. The icon updates to reflect your current choice.

## Reading Progress {#reading-progress}

In Grid and Mosaic layouts, the top-right corner of each card's thumbnail shows the bookmark's reading status:

- **No indicator** — not yet opened
- **Partial circle** — in progress; the arc angle represents how far through the article you've read
- **Checkmark (✓)** — read (completed)

Progress is tracked based on how far you scroll in the article — it reflects the farthest point you've reached, not your position when you leave.

A **video icon** or **picture icon** appears in the same corner for video and picture bookmarks respectively.

## Card Actions

Each card has four action buttons:

- **❤️ Favorite** — toggle the favorite status; filled when set
- **Archive** — move the bookmark to the archive (or back to My List if already archived); the card is removed from the current view when toggled
- **🌐 View Original** — open the original web page in an in-app viewer
- **🗑️ Delete** — delete the bookmark; a **"Bookmark deleted"** bar appears at the bottom with an **Undo** option

See [Organising](./organising.md) for more on how favorites, archive, labels, and deletion work across your whole collection.

## Long-press Context Menu

Long-pressing anywhere on a card opens a context menu for actions related to the bookmark's link. Long-pressing on the thumbnail opens an extended menu that also includes actions for the image:

**Link long-press:**
- Copy Link Address
- Copy Link Text
- Share Link
- Open in Browser

**Image/thumbnail long-press adds:**
- Copy Image
- Download Image
- Share Image

## Adding Bookmarks

### From within MyDeck

Tap the **+** button at the bottom-right of the list to open the **Add Link** sheet. Enter the URL of the page you want to save, and optionally a title and labels, then tap **Add**.

- **Add** — saves the bookmark and closes the sheet
- **View** — saves the bookmark and immediately opens it
- **Archive** — saves the bookmark directly to the archive

### From another app

You can save any link to MyDeck using Android's share sheet. In a browser or another app, tap **Share** and choose **Save to MyDeck**. A sheet appears with the URL (and title, if the app shared one) pre-filled. You can add or edit the title, add labels, mark it as a favorite (❤️), and choose **Add**, **View**, or **Archive**.

When opened via the share sheet, a 5-second countdown starts and the bookmark is added automatically when it reaches zero. Tap anywhere on the sheet to stop the countdown and take your time.

## Searching and Filtering

Tap the **filter icon** (≡) in the top bar to open the filter sheet. The sheet opens at roughly the top half of the screen. Scroll down within the sheet to see all options.

Active filters are shown as chips below the top bar. Tap the **×** on a chip to clear that filter.

When no bookmarks match the current filters, the list shows a "No bookmarks match your filters" message.

**Text fields:**
- **Search** — full-text search across title, article text, author, site name, and labels
- **Title** — search the title only
- **Author** — search the author field only
- **Site** — search the site name and domain
- **Label** — filter to bookmarks with a specific label

**Date range:**
- **From Date / To Date** — filter by when the bookmark was added

**Type** (choose one or more):
- Article, Video, Picture

**Progress** (choose one or more):
- Unviewed, In progress, Completed

**Toggle filters** (N/A / Yes / No):
- Is Favorite, Is Archived, Is Loaded, With Labels, With Errors

Tap **Search** to apply, or **Reset** to clear all filters.

### Search query syntax

The text search fields support the following operators:

- `startled cat` — finds bookmarks containing both **startled** and **cat**
- `"startled cat"` — finds the exact phrase **startled cat**
- `cat*` — finds words starting with **cat** (cat, catnip, caterpillar, etc.)
- `-startled cat` — finds **cat** but excludes **startled**

## Sorting

Tap the **sort icon** (↕) in the top bar to change the sort order. Options are:

- **Added** — date the bookmark was saved to Readeck
- **Published** — date the original article was published
- **Title** — alphabetical by title
- **Site Name** — alphabetical by site
- **Duration** — by estimated reading time

An arrow on the selected option shows the current direction. Tap the same option again to toggle between ascending and descending.

## Refreshing

Pull down on the list to sync with your Readeck server. This checks for new and updated bookmarks. To also check for bookmarks deleted on the server, use **Sync Bookmarks Now** in [Settings](./settings.md).

## Tablet and Landscape Layout

MyDeck adapts its navigation to the available screen space:

- **Phone portrait** — the navigation drawer slides in from the left when you tap ☰.
- **Phone landscape / Tablet portrait** — the drawer is replaced by a persistent **navigation rail** on the left edge showing icons for each section. Tap ☰ to open the full drawer if needed.
- **Tablet landscape** — the full navigation drawer is always visible alongside the bookmark list.

The bookmark list also adapts in Grid layout: on wider screens cards are arranged in multiple columns with the thumbnail above the title rather than to the left of it.
