# Organising

Labels, favorites, and archive are the tools MyDeck gives you to keep your bookmarks tidy and easy to find.

## Labels

Labels let you categorise your bookmarks with any words, phrases, or emojis you like. A bookmark can have any number of labels, and labels can be as broad or specific as you want.

### Adding Labels to a Bookmark

You can add labels in two places:

- **When saving a bookmark** — the Add Link sheet (opened from the **+** button or the Android share sheet) includes an **Add label** field. Type to search your existing labels; matching ones appear as suggestions below the field. Select a suggestion or finish typing to create a new one.

- **From Bookmark Details** — open any bookmark and tap **⋮** → **Bookmark Details**. The Labels section shows existing labels with **×** buttons to remove them, and an **Add label** field to add more. The same autocomplete suggestions appear as you type.

### Browsing by Label

Open the navigation drawer and tap **Labels** to open the label sheet. It lists all your labels alphabetically, each with a count of bookmarks carrying it. Use the **Search labels** field at the top of the sheet to find a specific label quickly if you have many.

Tap a label to see all bookmarks with that label. The resulting list works like any other bookmark list — you can sort, filter, and use all the same card actions.

You can also tap a label chip directly on any bookmark card in a list view to instantly filter that view to bookmarks with that label.

### Rename or Delete a Label

Because renaming or deleting a label affects every bookmark that carries it, both actions use a confirmation dialog rather than an immediate change.

There are two ways to access these actions:

- **From the label sheet** — long-press a label to open a menu with **Rename label** and **Delete label**
- **From a label's bookmark list** — tap **⋮** in the top bar and choose **Rename label** or **Delete label**

**Rename label** — opens a dialog with the current name pre-filled. Edit the name and tap **Rename**.

**Delete label** — opens a confirmation dialog. Tap **Delete** to confirm; the label is removed from all bookmarks.

## Favorites

Tap the **❤️** button on any bookmark card, or tap **❤️** in the top bar of the reading view, to mark a bookmark as a favorite. Tap again to remove it. The heart fills when a bookmark is a favorite.

Favorites are independent of My List and Archive — a favorite can be in either. To see all your favorites in one place, open the navigation drawer and tap **Favorites**.

## Archive

Archiving moves a bookmark out of **My List** into the **Archive**. Archived bookmarks are not deleted — they remain available to read and can be moved back to My List at any time.

You can archive a bookmark from several places:

- **Card action** — tap the Archive button on a bookmark card in any list view
- **Reading view** — tap Archive in the top bar
- **Add Link sheet** — tap **Archive** to save a new bookmark directly to the Archive

The card is removed from the current list immediately when you archive or unarchive it.

To see all your archived bookmarks, open the navigation drawer and tap **Archive**.

## Deleting Bookmarks

To delete a bookmark, tap the **🗑️** button on its card in a list view, or tap **⋮** → **Delete** in the reading view.

The bookmark is immediately removed from the list and a **"Bookmark deleted"** bar appears at the bottom of the screen. Tap **Undo** to restore it. The deletion is not finalised until you tap anywhere other than Undo or navigate away from the screen.
