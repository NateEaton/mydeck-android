# Labels

Labels let you organise your bookmarks into any categories you like. You can add as many labels as you want to a bookmark, and there's no limit on what a label can be — words, phrases, or even emojis.

To add labels to a bookmark, see [Bookmark View](./bookmark.md).

## Label List

Open the navigation drawer and tap **Labels** to open the label sheet. It lists all your labels alphabetically with a count of how many bookmarks carry each one. If you have many labels, use the **Search labels** field at the top of the sheet to find one quickly.

Tap a label to see all bookmarks carrying that label.

## Rename or Delete a Label

There are two ways to rename or delete a label:

- **From the label list:** Long-press a label in the label sheet to open a menu with **Rename label** and **Delete label**.
- **From a label's bookmark list:** When viewing bookmarks for a given label, tap the **⋮** overflow menu in the top bar and choose **Rename label** or **Delete label**.

Both actions use a confirmation dialog rather than an immediate change, because renaming or deleting a label affects every bookmark that carries it:

- **Rename label** — opens a dialog with the current name pre-filled. Edit the name and tap **Rename**.
- **Delete label** — opens a confirmation dialog. Tap **Delete** to confirm. The label is removed from all bookmarks.
