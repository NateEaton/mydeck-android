Bookmark view — article.

## Content Types

### Article

The article text is extracted and rendered as a clean, distraction-free reading view.

### Picture

The stored image is displayed full-screen.

### Video

A video player loads the content. Note that videos stream from their original servers (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.) and require an internet connection.

## Reading View

For articles, MyDeck shows the extracted text in a comfortable reading layout. The bookmark title appears at the top — tap the **✏️** icon beside it to edit the title.

The top bar provides quick access to the most-used actions:

- **❤️ Favorite** — toggle the favorite status
- **Archive** — move the bookmark to the archive (or remove it from there)
- **TT Typography** — open the reading settings sheet (see below)
- **🔍 Find in Article** — search for text within the article; matches are highlighted as you type
- **⋮ More** — overflow menu with additional actions

## Typography Settings

Tap the **TT** button in the top bar to open the reading settings sheet.

Reading settings.

- **Font** — System Default, Noto Serif, or Literata
- **Font size** — adjust with − and + (shown as a percentage)
- **Spacing** — Tight or Loose
- **Width** — Wide or Narrow
- **Justify text** — toggle on or off
- **Hyphenate words** — toggle on or off
- **Reset to defaults** — restore all reading settings at once

These settings are saved automatically and apply to every article you read.

## Overflow Menu

Tap the **⋮** button in the top bar for additional actions:

- **View Original** (🌐) — opens the original web page in an in-app viewer
- **Open in Browser** — opens the original URL in your default browser
- **Share Link** — opens the Android share sheet to share the bookmark's URL
- **Unread / Read** — toggle whether the bookmark has been read
- **Bookmark Details** — opens the Bookmark Details screen (see below)
- **Delete** — mark the bookmark for deletion; a brief undo option appears

## Bookmark Details

The **Bookmark Details** screen (opened from the overflow menu) shows the bookmark's full metadata: thumbnail, author, the dates it was added and published, reading time, and word count.

It also includes the **Labels** section where you can add or remove labels for the bookmark. Tap the **X** on an existing label to remove it, or type in the **Add label** field to add a new one. There's no limit on what a label can be, and emojis work too.
