# Contributing to MyDeck

Thanks for your interest in contributing. MyDeck is primarily a personal project, but bug reports, feature ideas, and pull requests are welcome.

## Reporting Bugs

Use the **Bug Report** issue template. The most useful things to include are:

- Clear steps to reproduce
- What you expected vs. what happened
- Android version and device
- App logs (Settings → Logs → share icon) or debug info from the Bookmark Details screen (debug builds only)

## Suggesting Features

Use the **Feature Request** issue template. A brief description of the problem you're trying to solve is more useful than jumping straight to a proposed solution.

## Pull Requests

**Please open an issue before starting significant work** so we can align on approach before you invest time in it.

When your PR is ready:

- Keep commits focused; squash-merge is the default workflow
- Follow the conventions in [docs/WORKFLOW.md](docs/WORKFLOW.md)
- If your change adds new string resources, add English placeholder strings to **all** language files — see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full list and an example

## Translations

Translation contributions are welcome. If you'd like to provide or improve a translation, open an issue to coordinate — the [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) localization section explains the file structure.
